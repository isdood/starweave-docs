## üéØ Core Innovation: Fractal-Recursive Pattern Resonance

### Conceptual Foundation

The system implements a novel approach to pattern-based computation using **fractal-recursive storage** and **multi-dimensional vector resonance**. Unlike traditional systems that store literal data sequences, this approach encodes information as generative rules that can be recursively applied across multiple scales.

### Key Architectural Principles

- **Generative Pattern Storage**: Information stored as recursive formulas rather than static instances
- **Multi-Scale Vector Representation**: Rich feature encoding across semantic, structural, and contextual dimensions
- **Adaptive Resonance Matching**: Dynamic similarity assessment that evolves based on usage patterns
- **Fractal Compression**: Self-similar patterns enable efficient representation at varying levels of detail
