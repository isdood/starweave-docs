# Pattern Resonance Models

## Overview
- The pattern resonance models are an attempt to create a standalone, novel AI architecture which will ideally replace the currently used open source models present in the multi-model approach.
- This architecture is currently solely Rust based, though Elixir is being considered for the orchestration layer due to the concurrency & distributed computing capabilities.
