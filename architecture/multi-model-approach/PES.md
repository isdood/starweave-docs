# Persistent Existence System for STARWEAVE

## Overview
The Persistent Existence System (PES) enables STARWEAVE to maintain continuous operation, learning, and self-improvement beyond direct user interactions. This document outlines the architecture, components, and benefits of this system.

## Core Philosophy

### Distributed Intelligence
- **Resource-Optimized Processing**: Leverage heterogeneous hardware across multiple nodes
- **Specialized Roles**: Dedicate specific nodes to different tasks based on their capabilities
- **Fault Tolerance**: Maintain system functionality even if individual nodes go offline

### Continuous Learning
- **Asynchronous Knowledge Acquisition**: Background processing of information
- **Temporal Awareness**: Maintain context and learning over extended periods
- **Self-Directed Growth**: Autonomous identification of knowledge gaps and learning opportunities

## System Architecture
